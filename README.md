## Project Setup

**Creating the Flutter Project**

To create the Flutter project, run the following command:
```
flutter create --org se.pixolity private_notes
```
This flag specifies the organization identifier for your project.
This helps uniquely identify your app and is used as the package name for Android and the bundle identifier for iOS.

## Firebase CLI
To use Firebase CLI for various tasks, follow these steps:

1. Install Firebase CLI:
```
npm install -g firebase-tools
```

```

## Firebase Configuration
After configuring FlutterFire, set up your Firebase project in the Firebase console:

1. Go to the [Firebase Console.](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli#install-cli-windows)
2. Configure authentication methods such as Email/Password, Google Sign-In, and Facebook Login.
